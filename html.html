                    <h1>About me</h1>
                    <p>Hello! My name is Tss, and I'm a passionate and aspiring Fullstack Web Developer currently honing my skills at Codecademy. With a background in computer science from high school, I have always been fascinated by the world of technology and coding.</p>
                    <p>At 21 years old, I'm dedicated to expanding my knowledge and expertise in both front-end and back-end development. My journey in web development has been fueled by a desire to create seamless and dynamic user experiences, and I'm constantly exploring new technologies and frameworks to stay at the forefront of the field.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me at the gym, staying active and healthy, or diving into the latest video games for some much-needed relaxation and inspiration. Balancing physical activity with creative and analytical pursuits helps me maintain a well-rounded and focused mindset.</p>
                    <p>I'm excited to bring my skills, enthusiasm, and unique perspective to new projects and challenges. Let's build something amazing together!</p>
